    <div class="image-placeholder">I would like to start by saying that I was DEVASTATED when I learned that I won't be able to join your birthday party by just 2 days. This got me wondering how I can still be a part of it...It also led me to think about how a gift can be preserved forever easily. I am not sure how this can be considered a proper gift, but I am pretty sure you will be able to see an effort here--and in the worst--case scenario-at least appreciate the effort. <br><br> As you said in the note you gave me at the graduation ceremony, we were somewhat distant until the end of the year and never talked besides group activities. A lot has changed since then, and we discovered how we can form such a great friendship over a short time...<br><br>Today, though, (depending on when you read this) it is not about celebrating our friendship, but rather, it is about celebrating your birthday. You have always been someone I looked up to-the way you were so social, the way you kept your grades high no matter what you end up doing, or not doing for that matter, and the way you always try to see a positive side in people and try to be the 'mature' one no matter the occasion. I believe with a steady heart that you will keep being a person this wonderful, and inspire many other people with your way of living the moment and enjoying life.<br><br>So here's to you ‚Äî to your kindness, your energy, and the way you make the people around you feel valued. I hope this year brings you new adventures, exciting challenges, and moments that make you laugh until your cheeks hurt (or piss your pants for that matter üò≠). Happy birthday, and thank you for being someone who makes life a little brighter just by being in it. </div>
